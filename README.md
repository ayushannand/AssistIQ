## Architecture

AssistIQ's architecture is designed to efficiently handle user queries and provide accurate responses:

1. The user inputs the query, which is processed by the input parser.
2. The input parser forwards the query to our custom interpreter.
3. The custom interpreter communicates with backend APIs to fetch the required data.
4. The data is passed to the model for generating a response.
5. The response is seamlessly displayed in our user-friendly interface.
