## Vicuna API Handler Documentation

The `handler` function is a serverless function designed to handle incoming HTTP requests. This function acts as a proxy to interact with an external Vicuna API service. It receives a JSON payload containing a `customer` object and a `question` from the client application and forwards the data to the Vicuna API endpoint for processing. The response from the Vicuna API is then returned to the client.

### Function Usage

The `handler` function is designed to be used in serverless environments like Next.js or similar frameworks. It serves as an API route or serverless function endpoint that can be accessed from the client-side to interact with the Vicuna API.

### Function Parameters

- `req`: The request object containing the incoming HTTP request data. It includes the body with the `customer` and `question` properties.

- `res`: The response object that allows sending the response back to the client.

### Function Implementation

The `handler` function performs the following steps:

1. Define the `apiEndpoint`: Specifies the URL of the Vicuna API service where the `question` and `customer` data will be sent for processing.

2. Extract `customer` and `question` from the request body: The function extracts the `customer` and `question` properties from the incoming request's body.

3. Make an API call to the Vicuna API: The function uses the `axios.post` method to make a POST request to the `apiEndpoint` with the `question` and `customer` data as the payload.

4. Handle the response: The function checks the response from the Vicuna API. If the status code is 200 (indicating a successful response), it extracts the `answer` property from the response data and sends it back to the client with a 200 status code. If the status code is not 200, it returns an error response with the corresponding status code (either 400 for a bad request or 500 for a server error).

5. Handle errors: If any error occurs during the API call (e.g., network error or server issue), the function catches the error and sends a 500 status code with an error message indicating that something went wrong with the Vicuna API.

### Response Format

- If the Vicuna API responds with a successful status code (200), the function returns a JSON response in the following format:

```json
{
  "response": "Answer text goes here"
}
```

- If the Vicuna API responds with a non-200 status code (e.g., 400 or 500), the function returns an error response in the following format:

```json
{
  "error": "Error message goes here"
}
```

### Error Handling

The `handler` function is designed to handle different types of errors that may occur during the API call to the Vicuna service. If an error occurs during the API call, the function catches it and responds with a 500 status code and an error message indicating that something went wrong.

### Note

- The `axios` library is used to make HTTP requests in the function. Ensure that the `axios` library is properly installed and accessible in your serverless environment.

- The `apiEndpoint` variable in the function should be set to the correct URL of the Vicuna API service, including the necessary authentication and routing details.

- The function's behavior is dependent on the specific implementation and response format of the Vicuna API service. Make sure the Vicuna API provides the expected response format and handles incoming requests appropriately.
