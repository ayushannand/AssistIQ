## Flask App for LLM (Vicuna) Question Answering

The provided code is a Flask application that serves as an API to answer questions about JSON objects using the LLM (Vicuna) language model. LLM (Linguistic Language Model) is a type of language model used for natural language generation tasks.

### Description

The Flask app loads the LLM model (Vicuna) and defines a prompt template for answering questions based on the given JSON object. The LLMChain instance is created to handle the question-answering process. The API provides an endpoint `/answer` that accepts POST requests with JSON data containing a `question` and a `customer` JSON object. The app then generates responses to the questions using the LLM model.

### Installation

To run this Flask app, ensure you have the required dependencies installed. You may use a virtual environment to manage the dependencies. To install the necessary packages, use the following command:

```bash
pip install flask langchain
```

### Usage

1. Import the required modules in your Python environment:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from langchain.llms import LlamaCpp
from langchain.callbacks.manager import CallbackManager
from langchain.callbacks.streaming_stdout import StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler
from langchain.prompts.prompt import PromptTemplate
from langchain.chains import LLMChain
```

2. Create a Flask app and load the LLM (Vicuna) model:

```python
app = Flask(__name__)

# Load the Vicuna model
callback_manager = CallbackManager([StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler()])
llm = LlamaCpp(
    temperature=0,
    model_path="../llms/wizard-vicuna-13B.ggmlv3.q5_1.bin",
    callback_manager=callback_manager,
    verbose=True,
    n_ctx=1024,
    n_gpu_layers=43,
    n_batch=512,
    max_token=128
)
```

3. Define the prompt template for generating responses:

```python
template = """Your prompt template goes here"""
prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["input", "custObject"],
    template=template
)

# Create the LLMChain instance
llm_chain = LLMChain(prompt=prompt, llm=llm, verbose=True)
```

4. Define the API endpoint and handle incoming POST requests:

```python
@app.route('/answer', methods=['POST'])
def answer_question():
    question = request.json['question']
    customer = request.json['customer']
    
    output = llm_chain.run(input=question, custObject=customer)
    
    return jsonify({'answer': output})
```

5. Run the Flask app:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

### API Endpoint

The Flask app exposes an API endpoint `/answer` that accepts POST requests. It expects JSON data containing the following keys:

- `question`: The question to be answered based on the given JSON object.
- `customer`: The JSON object that contains customer information.

Upon receiving the request, the app generates the response using the LLM model and returns it as a JSON object with the key `answer`.

### Note

- The code provided assumes that the LLM (Vicuna) model and other necessary modules are properly installed and the required model file is located in the specified path.

- The LLM model is used to generate responses based on the prompt template. The actual logic for generating responses is implemented in the LLMChain instance.

- Ensure that the `langchain` library is properly installed and accessible in your Python environment to run this Flask app.
