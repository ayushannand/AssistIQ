## ResponseDisplay Component Documentation

The `ResponseDisplay` component is a React functional component that provides a simple user interface for fetching and displaying data based on an email input. It uses the `useState` hook from React for managing the component's state and Axios library to make asynchronous API requests. This component is typically used to retrieve combined data related to the given email through the `getCombinedData` function from the `apiWrapper.js` module.

### Usage

To use the `ResponseDisplay` component in your React application, follow these steps:

1. Import the `ResponseDisplay` component into your desired file.

```javascript
import ResponseDisplay from "./ResponseDisplay";
```

2. Render the `ResponseDisplay` component in your parent component.

```javascript
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Other components */}
      <ResponseDisplay />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Props

The `ResponseDisplay` component does not accept any props. However, it internally handles the state for the email input and the API response data.

### Component State

The `ResponseDisplay` component manages the following states using the `useState` hook:

- `email`: Holds the value of the email input field. It is initialized as an empty string and updates when the user types in the input field.

- `response`: Holds the response data received from the API. It is initially set to `null` and is updated once the API call is successful.

- `loading`: A boolean state that is set to `true` while waiting for the API response and set to `false` after the API call is completed, regardless of whether it was successful or not.

### Methods

The `ResponseDisplay` component defines two methods:

- `handleInputChange`: This method is triggered whenever the user types into the email input field. It updates the `email` state with the entered value.

- `handleSubmit`: This method is called when the form is submitted. It triggers the API request using the `getCombinedData` function with the entered email value. If the API call is successful, the response data is stored in the `response` state. If there is an error during the API call, the error is logged to the console.

### Styles

The component uses CSS modules to style its elements. The styles are defined in the `responseDisplay.module.css` file, and they are applied to the respective elements using the `styles` object.

### UI Components

The `ResponseDisplay` component consists of the following UI elements:

- A form with an input field for entering the email.
- A submit button to trigger the API call.
- A loading message displayed while waiting for the API response.
- A response section that displays the JSON response data if available.

### Note

- The `getCombinedData` function used in the `handleSubmit` method is assumed to be a custom function defined elsewhere in the application. It handles the API call and returns the response data. Ensure that the `getCombinedData` function is properly implemented to handle the API request.

- The API endpoint to retrieve the combined data based on the provided email should be appropriately defined in the `getCombinedData` function or the `axios.get` call inside the `handleSubmit` method.
